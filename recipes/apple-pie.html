    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Apple pie is a classic dessert made with a flaky pastry crust and filled with sweet and tangy cooked apples. It
        is often served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Roll out one disc of the pie dough and fit it into a 9-inch pie dish.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the sliced apples, sugar, lemon juice, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt.</li>
        <li>Pour the apple mixture into the prepared pie crust and dot with butter.</li>
        <li>Roll out the second disc of pie dough and place it over the filling.</li>
        <li>Trim the edges and crimp to seal the top and bottom crusts together.</li>
        <li>Cut slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.</li>
        <li>Brush the top of the pie with the beaten egg.</li>
        <li>Bake for 45-50 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling.</li>
